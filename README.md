# shebang-set-grammar Atom package

When opening a file with Atom, the grammar is recognized. Mostly by the file extension (.sh => bash, .py => python, ...).
But when there is no file extension, Atom does not recognized any grammar.

This module aims to detect the file's grammar from the shebang (#! ...).
